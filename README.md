## Installation
The mod is currently only available for 1.20.1 (neo)forge. Fabric/Quilt versions and 1.19.2 versions may come later.<br>
[Almost Unified](https://modrinth.com/mod/almost-unified) is required to be installed.<br>
If you have the config file ``config/almostunified/unify.json`` please delete/replace it, don't do this if you are playing a modpack made by someone else(take advise from them on this). The file may require deletion or replacement after every update, for the newer features. For more info please view the [Wiki](https://github.com/Amronos/createaddoncompatibility/wiki/Unification-Config-Changes#changes-to-the-config-by-create-addon-compatibility).

## Suggestions / More Compatibility Features
If you want to change something like which mod takes priority please have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Amronos/createaddoncompatibility/wiki/Unification-Config-Changes#changes-to-the-config-by-create-addon-compatibility). <br>
I do have more compatibility features planned, but if you have any ideas feel free to create an issue on GitHub or tell me in the Discord server.

Thanks to the AlmostReliable team for making Almost Unified, without which this mod would have been very difficult to make.<br>
