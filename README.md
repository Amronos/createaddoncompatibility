## Installation
The mod is currently only available for 1.20.1 (neo)forge. Fabric/Quilt versions and 1.19.2 versions may come later.<br>
[Almost Unified](https://modrinth.com/mod/almost-unified) is required to be installed.<br>
<br><br>

## Compatibility Configuration
To change which mod has the priority in compatibility, modify the `modPriorities` in `config/almostunified/unify.json`, for more info look at [this](https://github.com/AlmostReliable/almostunified/wiki/Unification-Config).
<br><br>
There are datapacks present in the mod which allow you to change certain things about compatibility between different mods.<br>
They can be enabled during world creation or by using the ``/datapack enable`` command.
<br><br>

## Suggestions / More Compatibility Features
If you want to change something like which mod takes priority please have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Amronos/createaddoncompatibility/wiki/Unification-Config-Changes#changes-to-the-config-by-create-addon-compatibility). <br>
I do have more compatibility features planned, but if you have any ideas feel free to create an issue on GitHub or tell me in the Discord server.

Thanks to the AlmostReliable team for making Almost Unified, without which this mod would have been very difficult to make.<br>
